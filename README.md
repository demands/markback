# markback

Sensible conversion from HTML to markdown. Will run in
a browser, in a command line, or as a node module.
It uses the DOM to do its magic: Whatever the browser
sees should be what you get.

## Examples:

```html
<h1>This is a test</h1>
```

```markdown
# This is a test
```

## FAQ:

**Q: Are you compatible with GitHub Flavored Markdown?**
**A:** Not quite yet. Seems like a good v2.0 feature.
